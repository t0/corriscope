""" hardware_map module: defines the HardwareMap base class to allow tracking and managing a collection of hardware resources.

`HardwareMap` owns all hardware-class discovery and bookkeeping:

- In-memory registries of classes and instances (maintained automatically by
  `__init_subclass__` / `__new__`).
- Lazy loading of hardware platform classes listed in the manifest
  `corriscope/hardware/supported_hardware.py:HARDWARE`. The manifest is read via
  function-local imports from the classmethods below, so it can refer to
  `Motherboard`/`Crate` (which import `HardwareMap`) without
  creating a circular import.
- Lookups that transparently fall back to the manifest when a class has not
  yet been imported (`get_class_by_name`, `get_class_by_part_number`,
  `get_class_by_ipmi_part_number`).

External code must only use the public methods below; it must never access
the internal registries (``_class_registry``, ``_instance_registry``,
``_base_hardware_class_registry``) or the `supported_hardware` module
directly.

Naming conventions:

- ``registered`` = currently in the in-memory registry (the class has been
  imported and its ``__init_subclass__`` has run).
- ``supported``  = declared in the ``HARDWARE`` manifest (may or may not be
  loaded yet).
