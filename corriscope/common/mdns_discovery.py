    """ Automatically detect IceBoards and IceCrates on the network using mDNS
    and add them to the hardware map.

    Parameters:

        crates (list): List of crates whose boards we want to add to the hardware map. It can contain:

                [(model1, serial1), (model2, serial2), ...]: Matches specific
                model and serial number. model can be "*" to match any
                mmodel. serial can be "*" to match any serial. serial can be
                a string or an integer.

                "*" is equivalent to [('*', '*')]  : matches any crate model
                and serial, i.e. all discovered boards from all crates
                are added.

                None or an empty list: no boards are added on a crate
                membership basis.


        boards (list):  List of boards we want to add to the hardware map.

                [(model1, serial1), (model2, serial2), ...]: Matches specific
                model and serial number. model can be "*" to match any
                mmodel. serial can be "*" to match any serial. serial can be
                a string or an integer.

                "*" is equivalent to [('*', '*')]  : matches any board model
                and serial, i.e. all discovered boards from all crates
                are added.

                None or an empty list: no boards are added on a crate
                membership basis.

        timeout (float): Maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for mDNS replies on each attempt.

        inter_reply_timeout (int or float): If non-zero, the current attempt
            stops when no reply has arrived for `inter_reply_timeout` seconds
            (measured from the start of the attempt if no reply has been
            received yet, otherwise from the last reply). Two use cases:

                - Shorten the search once the expected burst of replies has
                  arrived (set it slightly larger than the inter-reply
                  spacing within the burst).

                - Give up fast on a dropped query so the caller's retry loop
                  can launch a fresh attempt instead of waiting the full
                  `timeout` (set it to ~2-3x the expected first-reply
                  latency).

            The attempt still stops after `timeout` regardless. Disabled if
            `inter_reply_timeout` is `None`.

        case_sensitive (bool): If true, motherboard and crate model names matching will be case sensitive.

        retries (int): Number of times to retry the mDNS discovery if not all
            specifically-requested boards/crates were found. Each retry uses a
            fresh ``AsyncZeroconf`` instance. Wildcard targets (``'*'``) do not
            trigger retries because they have no completion criterion.
            Discovered boards from previous attempts are kept (``get_unique_instance``
            is idempotent), so a retry only needs to find the still-missing ones.
            The total wall-clock cost is at most ``(retries + 1) * timeout``.

    Return the IP address for the specified name by issuing a mDNS query directly.

    Parameters:

        name (str): Host name to lookup. Normally ends with ".local" or
            ".local.". Thhe '.local' will be added automatically if missing.

        timeout (float): time to wait for an answer, in seconds. The function will return
            as soon as there is an answer. mDNS devices are not obligated to
            respond more than once a second, so setting a value less than 1
            might cause a timeout if the device had just been queried by some
            other system.

    Returns:
        IPV4 address as a str; None if not found
