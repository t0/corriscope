"""
Module for capturing and writing raw corelated data from a t0.CRS board.

The script can be run within an ipython session.

Make sure you've got the latest firmware that supports corr8 mode with all 8 channelizers!

You can connect to a board with serial number 0016 in ipython by running

    run sifpga_crs_corr_capture.py --serial 0016 --stderr_log_level info --prog 2

    System Requirements:

    The Ethernet interface must be set to receive Jumbo frames:

            sudo ifconfig eno1 mtu 9000

    The UDP buffers shall be increased to reduce packet loss to a minimum::

        sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=26214400
        sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default=26214400
        sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.udp_mem='26214400 26214400 26214400'
        sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.udp_rmem_min=26214400

    Check udp buffers::

        sysctl -a | grep mem

    Monitor UDP buffer::

        watch -cd -n .5 "cat /proc/net/udp"

        The POCKET_CORRELATOR class is a wrapper for the FPGAArray class of fpga_array.py designed to optimize data collection 
        with a t0.CRS board. It provides an additional layer of processing to simplify measuremsnts of ADC, FUNCGEN, FFT, SCALER,
        and correlated data. 

        This class was initially designed to function as an automated script for a single-board digital backend 
        for computing and storing visibilities at the Deep Dish Development Array (D3A) at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical 
        Observatory (DRAO), the site of the Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio transient Detector (CHORD).

        Parameters
        ----------
        hwm : (str) The hardware map (hwm) provides a description of the part number and serial number of the part
        to which you'd like to connect. This script is designed for t0.CRS boards, so the part number will always
        be "crs" (unless this script is upgraded in the future.) 

        Ex) hwm = 'crs 0016' will search the network for t0.CRS SN0016.

        stderr_log_level : (str) Specifies the logging level. See corriscope/corriscope/fpga_array.py for details.
        Default is 'info'. 'debug' provides the most information, while 'warning' is the most silent.

        prog : (str) Specifies whether to force the FPGA to be programmed. '0' does not program the FPGA.
        '1' programs the FPGA only if it is not already programmed; if it is, the board is not re-programmed.
        '2' forces the FPGA to be programmed, even if it is already programmed.

        ----------
        n_frames : (int) Number of frames captured per function call. n_frames must be an even-valued integer, as UCAP only
        receives data in bursts of 16 frames. 

        data_source : (str) A string that sets whether real ADC data or data stored in the FUNCGEN buffer are sent out of the FUNCGEN.

            If 'adc', then real digitized data from the ADC will pass through the CHAN signal chain.

            Otherwise, the user can specify a desired function listed in corriscope/corriscope/fpga_firmware/chfpga/f_engine/funcgen.py
            Keyword arguments can be included (see below).

        channels : (list) A list of the input channels (i.e., 0 for ADC1, 1 for ADC2, etc.) for which you'd like to recover data.
        The default is to receive data from all channels [0, .., 7].

        period : (float) Time (in seconds) between captured bursts. 0.02 is the minimum recommended to not saturate the ethernet link. 

        split : (bool) Whether to include a "frames" axis for the data array, which allows the user to inspect individual frames.

            If True:
                axis 0: ADC channel
                axis 1: frame number
                axis 2: sample number

                axis 0: ADC channel
                axis 1: sample number, with all frames flattened

        verbose (int): Verbosity level. 0: no messages, 1: basic messages, 2: detailed messages

        function_kwargs : (dict) Arguments for FUNCGEN functions passed to set_channelizer(). Used when data_source is not 'adc'.
        See corriscope/corriscope/fpga_firmware/chfpga/f_engine/funcgen.py for functions and their arguments.

        Returns
        -------
        d_adc : (np.ndarray) The ADC data. The 14-bit ADC data is stored as two-byte/16-bit integers, so the data
        needs to be shifted down by 2 bits in order to recover the correct values. This shift is done automatically
        within this function.

        """
        Read FFT frames using UCAP. By default, UCAP is in mode 0, meaning 2 frames for each ADC channel will be
        captured per burst of 16 frames.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n_frames : (int) Number of frames captured per function call. n_frames must be an even-valued integer, as UCAP only
        receives data in bursts of 16 frames. 

        fft_bit_res : (str) The bit resolution of the captured FFT data. The FFT module generates 32+32-bit values for 4 frequency
        bins on every clock cycle, and the output bus of the FFT module is 128 bits wide. 

            If fft_bit_res is '16+16', 4 frequency bins are captured for a single clock cycle, such that
            128 bits / 4 frequency bins = 32 = 16+16 bits per frequency bin can be captured. The upper 16+16 bits of the
            FFT are captured in this case.

            If fft_bit_res is '32+32', only 2 frequency bins are captured for a single clock cycle, such that
            128 bits / 2 frequency bins = 64 = 32+32 bits per frequency bin (i.e., the full resolution of the FFT 
            will be returned). Therefore, since we cannot capture every frequency bin at full resoltion at the same time, 
            the even and odd bins are captured separately (that is, they come from physically different FFT frames). 

                **As such, the injected signal must be roughly stationary in time, such that we can justify combining even and odd 
                bins from different frames. Caution is therefore warranted in using this mode, though it is preferable to ]
                recover the full FFT resolution.**

        data_source : (str) A string that sets whether real ADC data or data stored in the FUNCGEN buffer are sent out of the FUNCGEN.

            If 'adc', then real digitized data from the ADC will pass through the CHAN signal chain.

            Otherwise, the user can specify a desired function listed in corriscope/corriscope/fpga_firmware/chfpga/f_engine/funcgen.py
            Keyword arguments can be included (see below).

        channels : (list) A list of the input channels (i.e., 0 for ADC1, 1 for ADC2, etc.) for which you'd like to recover data.
        The default is to receive data from all channels [0, .., 7].

        fft_bypass : (bool) Whether or not to bypass the FFT. Why include an option to bypass the FFT when you are requesting post-gain frames,
        you might ask? Well, sometimes it is useful to use the FUNCGEN to create a simulated spectrum, in which case you wouldn't want 
        the signal you have set in the FUNCGEN to propagate through the firmware FFT. 
        
            With the fft_bypass option, you have the power to create simulated FFT outputs for signal path validation.

            If True, the FFT is bypassed.

            If False, the FFT is not bypassed. Default.

        period : (float) Time (in seconds) between captured bursts. 0.02 is the minimum recommended to not saturate the ethernet link. 

        split : (bool) Whether to include a "frames" axis for the data array, which allows the user to inspect individual frames.

            If True:
                axis 0: ADC channel
                axis 1: frame number
                axis 2: sample number

            If False:
                axis 0: ADC channel
                axis 1: sample number, with all frames flattened

        verbose (int): Verbosity level. 0: no messages, 1: basic messages, 2: detailed messages

        function_kwargs : (dict) Arguments for FUNCGEN functions passed to set_channelizer(). Used when data_source is not 'adc'.
        See corriscope/corriscope/fpga_firmware/chfpga/f_engine/funcgen.py for functions and their arguments.

        Returns
        -------
        d_fft : (np.ndarray) The FFT data. The frequency axis is returned in the proper order.

        The shape of the array depends upon the choice for the "split" parameter.

            If split is True:
                d_fft.shape = (self.NPOLS, n_frames, self.NBINS)

        """
        Compute digital gains used to quantize FFT data into 4+4 bits with the SCALER. When floating point
        digital gains are used, the digital gains correspond to an 11-bit "linear" (i.e., mantissa) component 
        which is directly multiplied with the FFT data, and a 5-bit "logarithmic" (i.e., exponent) component 
        which applies a bit shift, with a maximum value of 2^5 = 32 bits, or equivalently a multiplication by 2^32. 
        The maximum digital gain that can be applied is therefore

            maximum_gain = maximum_gain_lin * maximum_gain_log = 2^11 * 2^32.

        The application of the digital gains results in a "post-gain" value with a bit-depth of 48+48 bits, of which the
        upper 4+4 MSBSs are taken and rounded to perform the 4+4-bit quantization.

        Since we can recover the full resolution of the FFT data, we can compute directly the digital gains
        necessary for optimial quantization in the SCALER, which is defined as a "target" SCALER magnitude. 
        We can express the application of digital gains as

            target_full = gain * |FFT|,

        where target_full = target * 2^44, and |FFT| refers to the magnitude of FFT data, averaged for a 
        specified number of frames to reduce noise. The digital gains are therefore simply

            gain = target_full / |FFT|.

        This function uses the set_gain_table() function of the SCALER module (see scaler.py), which performs 
        additional processing of the digital gains as computed with the equation above prior to writing them
        to the memory banks of the SCALER. Therefore, the "theoretical" gains, since they are computed as 
        Python floating point numbers, are optimally broken up into linear and logarithmic components. As such,
        the "theoretical" gains are not necessarily equivalent to those that are actually applied by the SCALER,
        so the "actual" gains are returned to the user by this function. See

            corriscope/corriscope/fpga_firmware/chfpga/f_engine/scaler.py 

        for more information on how the "theoretical" gains are processed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        target : (float) The average magnitude of the 4+4-bit SCALER frames. If target is too low, quantization
        noise will begin to dominate over the signal. If target is too high, both the SCALER and the accumulator 
        of the correlator might saturate. The recommended value is borrowed from that used in the CHIME F-Engine,
        which was determined empirically by Prof. Juan Mena-Parra of UofT. 

        n_fft_frames : (int) The number of FFT frames whose magnitudes are average when computing the digital gains.

        data_source : (str) A string that sets whether real ADC data or data stored in the FUNCGEN buffer are sent out of the FUNCGEN.

            If 'adc', then real digitized data from the ADC will pass through the CHAN signal chain.

            Otherwise, the user can specify a desired function listed in corriscope/corriscope/fpga_firmware/chfpga/f_engine/funcgen.py
            Keyword arguments can be included (see below).

        channels : (list) A list of the input channels (i.e., 0 for ADC1, 1 for ADC2, etc.) for which you'd like to recover data.
        The default is to receive data from all channels [0, .., 7].

        fft_bypass : (bool) Whether or not to bypass the FFT. Why include an option to bypass the FFT when you are requesting post-gain frames,
        you might ask? Well, sometimes it is useful to use the FUNCGEN to create a simulated spectrum, in which case you wouldn't want 
        the signal you have set in the FUNCGEN to propagate through the firmware FFT. 
        
            With the fft_bypass option, you have the power to create simulated FFT outputs for signal path validation.

            If True, the FFT is bypassed.

            If False, the FFT is not bypassed. Default.

        bank : (int) The FPGA has enough memory to store two sets of digital gains, each of which are stored in different "banks".
        The digital gains computed in a given call of compute_gains() will be written to the specified bank.
        Possible values are 0 or 1.

        return_scaler_frames : (bool) Whether or not to read SCALER frames and return to the user, which can
        be used to verify if the digital gains have been set properly. By default, the number of frames returned is
        equivalent to n_fft_frames.

        save_gains : (bool) Whether or not to save the digital gains in an HDF5 file, which calls save_gains() if True.
        Set to True, for example, if you are saving correlated data and need to apply the digital gains for offline analysis.

        digital_gains_parent_path : (str) A parent directory containing sub-directories of digital gains. Only used if save_gains is True.

        digital_gains_dir_name : (str) The directory in which the digital gains will be stored. This directory lives within
        the parent digital_gains_path directory. Only used if save_gains is True.

        function_kwargs : (dict) Arguments for FUNCGEN functions passed to set_channelizer(). Used when data_source is not 'adc'.
        See corriscope/corriscope/fpga_firmware/chfpga/f_engine/funcgen.py for functions and their arguments.

        Returns
        -------
        d_fft : (np.ndarray) The raw FFT frames used for the digital gain computation. The shape is 
        (NPOLS, n_fft_frames, NBINS).

        d_fft_mean_mag : (np.ndarray) The average magnitude of the FFT frames, used for computing the digital gains.
        The shape is (NPOLS, NBINS).

        gain_lin_actual : (np.ndarray) The linear component of the "actual" digital gains. The shape is (NPOLS, NBINS).

        gain_log_actual : (np.ndarray) The logarithmic component of the "actual" digital gains. The shape is (NPOLS, NBINS).

        d_sclr : (np.ndarray) An array of SCALER frames, returned if return_scaler_frames = True. The SCALER frames 
        are captured after the digital gains have been computed and applied, so these frames can be used to verify 
        whether the digital gains were set properly. The shape is (NPOLS, n_fft_frames, NBINS).

        """
        Read "post-gain" FFT frames using UCAP. "Post-gain" FFT frames refer to the intermediate 48+48-bit value resulting from the 
        multiplication of FFT data by digital gains prior to 4+4-bit quantization in the SCALER. read_post_gain_frames() returns to the
        user to recover the upper 16+16 bits of the post-gain FFT frames.

        Therefore, this function allows the user to use the digital gains to recover 16+16 bits of FFT data, tuned to the bits
        that the user wishes to recover. This method is advantageous compared to reading the upper 16+16 bits of FFT data with read_fft_frames(), 
        as the signal may not necessarily be contained within those bits of the FFT. read_post_gain_frames() enables user-tunability of
        the FFT data so that the bits containing the signal can be recovered. Of course, the 32+32-bit mode of read_fft_frames() enables
        the capture of full-resolution FFT data, but the even and odd bins must be read separately, while this method enables all bins
        to be captured at the same time. 

        By default, UCAP is in mode 0, meaning 2 frames for each ADC channel will be captured per burst of 16 frames.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n_frames : (int) Number of frames captured per function call. n_frames must be an even-valued integer, as UCAP only
        receives data in bursts of 16 frames. 

        data_source : (str) A string that sets whether real ADC data or data stored in the FUNCGEN buffer are sent out of the FUNCGEN.

            If 'adc', then real digitized data from the ADC will pass through the CHAN signal chain.

            Otherwise, the user can specify a desired function listed in corriscope/corriscope/fpga_firmware/chfpga/f_engine/funcgen.py
            Keyword arguments can be included (see below).

        channels : (list) A list of the input channels (i.e., 0 for ADC1, 1 for ADC2, etc.) for which you'd like to recover data.
        The default is to receive data from all channels [0, .., 7].

        fft_bypass : (bool) Whether or not to bypass the FFT. Why include an option to bypass the FFT when you are requesting post-gain frames,
        you might ask? Well, sometimes it is useful to use the FUNCGEN to create a simulated spectrum, in which case you wouldn't want 
        the signal you have set in the FUNCGEN to propagate through the firmware FFT. 
        
            With the fft_bypass option, you have the power to create simulated FFT outputs for signal path validation.

            If True, the FFT is bypassed.

            If False, the FFT is not bypassed. Default.

        period : (float) Time (in seconds) between captured bursts. 0.02 is the minimum recommended to not saturate the ethernet link. 

        split : (bool) Whether to include a "frames" axis for the data array, which allows the user to inspect individual frames.

            If True:

        Read SCALER frames using UCAP. By default, UCAP is in mode 0, meaning 2 frames for each ADC channel will be
        captured per burst of 16 frames.

        SCALER data is returned as 4+4-bit integers.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n_frames : (int) Number of frames captured per function call. n_frames must be an even-valued integer, as UCAP only
        receives data in bursts of 16 frames. 

        data_source : (str) A string that sets whether real ADC data or data stored in the FUNCGEN buffer are sent out of the FUNCGEN.

            If 'adc', then real digitized data from the ADC will pass through the CHAN signal chain.

            Otherwise, the user can specify a desired function listed in corriscope/corriscope/fpga_firmware/chfpga/f_engine/funcgen.py
            Keyword arguments can be included (see below).

        channels : (list) A list of the input channels (i.e., 0 for ADC1, 1 for ADC2, etc.) for which you'd like to recover data.
        The default is to receive data from all channels [0, .., 7].

        fft_bypass : (bool) Whether or not to bypass the FFT. Why include an option to bypass the FFT when you are requesting post-gain frames,
        you might ask? Well, sometimes it is useful to use the FUNCGEN to create a simulated spectrum, in which case you wouldn't want 
        the signal you have set in the FUNCGEN to propagate through the firmware FFT. 
        
            With the fft_bypass option, you have the power to create simulated FFT outputs for signal path validation.

            If True, the FFT is bypassed.

            If False, the FFT is not bypassed. Default.

        scaler_bypass : (bool) Whether or not to bypass the Scaler, similar to the fft_bypass argument.
        
            With the scaler_bypass option, you have the power to create simulated Scaler outputs for signal path validation when
            combined with the fft_bypass option.

            If True, the Scaler is bypassed.

            If False, the Scaler is not bypassed. Default.

        period : (float) Time (in seconds) between captured bursts. 0.02 is the minimum recommended to not saturate the ethernet link. 

        split : (bool) Whether to include a "frames" axis for the data array, which allows the user to inspect individual frames.

            If True:
                axis 0: ADC channel
                axis 1: frame number
                axis 2: sample number

            If False:
                axis 0: ADC channel

        d_scaler : (np.ndarray) The 4+4-bit SCALER data. The frequency axis is returned in the proper order.

        """
        Read correlated and accumulated frames. Correlation is always performed in real-time in the FPGA.
        Accumulation is performed in two steps: (1) n_firmware_frames are accumulated in the FPGA,
        and (2) n_software_frames of pre-data accumulated for n_firmware_frames are accumulated in Python.
        The two-step accumulation reduces the data rate such that data can be sent over the 1G network, 
        enabling longer integration times. 

        This function is a wrapper for read_corr_frames() from 

            corriscope/corriscope/fpga_firmware/chfpga/x_engine/UCORR.py

        and essentially performs the same operations, with some added processing of data specific to the 
        POCKET_CORRELATOR class.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data_source : (str) A string that sets whether real ADC data or data stored in the FUNCGEN buffer are sent out of the FUNCGEN.

            If 'adc', then real digitized data from the ADC will pass through the CHAN signal chain.

            Otherwise, the user can specify a desired function listed in corriscope/corriscope/fpga_firmware/chfpga/f_engine/funcgen.py
            Keyword arguments can be included (see below).

        fft_bypass : (bool) Whether or not to bypass the FFT. Why include an option to bypass the FFT when you are requesting post-gain frames,
        you might ask? Well, sometimes it is useful to use the FUNCGEN to create a simulated spectrum, in which case you wouldn't want 
        the signal you have set in the FUNCGEN to propagate through the firmware FFT. 
        
            With the fft_bypass option, you have the power to create simulated FFT outputs for signal path validation.

            If True, the FFT is bypassed.

            If False, the FFT is not bypassed. Default.

        scaler_bypass : (bool) Whether or not to bypass the Scaler, similar to the fft_bypass argument.
        
            With the scaler_bypass option, you have the power to create simulated Scaler outputs for signal path validation when
            combined with the fft_bypass option.

            If True, the Scaler is bypassed.

            If False, the Scaler is not bypassed. Default.
            
        n_software_frames : (int) The number of pre-integrated firmware frames to integrate in Python.
        Increasing this value increases the total integration time.

        number_of_results : (int) The number of integrated frames to return. Each "result" contains
        all frequency bins for each correlated product, integrated for the specified number of frames.

        flush : (bool) Whether to flush the UDP buffers. If data is allowed to accumulate in the UDP
        buffers for a while, it's a good idea to flush the buffer and get a fresh start.

        data_timeout : (float) The socket timeout for capturing data in the UDP buffer.

        flush_timeout : (float) The socket timeout for flushing data in the UDP buffer.

        return_format : (str) The format in which to return the data. Only 'raw' has been tested with 
        the Pocket Correlator, and therefore should always be used by default. 'raw' returns the data
        in the native format without rearranging the data (although the bin_map correction is applied
        in this wrapper function).

        verbose : (int) Verbosity level. 0: no messages, 1: basic messages, 2: detailed messages

        corr_is_configured : (bool) Whether or not the correlator is already configured. If False,
        the correaltor will be automatically configured with the following three parameters.

        autocorr_only : (int) Bit to choose between return all correlated products, or only autocorrelations.
        Default is to send all N(N-1)/2 correlated products.

            0: return all products
            1: return autocorrelations only

        no_accum : (int) Bit to choose between accumulating (i.e., summing) correalted SCALER frames, and not
        accumulating. Default is to accumulate.

            0: do accumulate
            1: do not accumulate

        n_firmware_frames : (int) Number of frames to accumulate in firmware. Take care not to set this too 
        low (see minimum), as this will increase the data rate, and could lead to overrun condition. Also take
        care not to set this too high (see maximum), as this may cause increased saturation. The firmware 
        accumulator can add numbers up to 18+18-bit values, at which point they saturate.

        Use the recommended value!

            16384 - 1: recommended
            32768 - 1: maximum

        function_kwargs : (dict) Arguments for FUNCGEN functions passed to set_channelizer(). Used when data_source is not 'adc'.
        See corriscope/corriscope/fpga_firmware/chfpga/f_engine/funcgen.py for functions and their arguments.

        Returns
        -------
        t1 : (float) A rough timestamp using time.time(). 

            **IMPORTANT**: this value is not synchronized with the first frame for a given result, but is instead 
            read immediately before capturing correlated data. Note that this results in some timing error in the 
            interferometer. For testbed or prototype arrays, such a timestamp may be sufficient, but for science-ready
            arrays, synchronization must be implemented.

            Synchronized timestamps will be included in future upgrades to the Pocket Correlator.

        d_corr : (np.ndarray) The correlated data. The shape is (number_of_results, NBINS, NCORR_PROD). Note that the
        final axis of size NCORR_PROD must be indexed using self.prod, which is created using generate_prod_map().

        count : (np.ndarray) The actual number of software frames that have been integrated for each 
        frequency bins. count should be a 1D array of length NBINS, whose values are equivalent to 
        n_software_frames; any lower values indicate that packets are being dropped, or otherwise not 
        integrated in Python. count there informs the user of dropped packets, which is important to keep
        track of due to the relationship between integration time and noise through the radiometer equation.

        sat : (np.ndarray) The number of saturations that occurred in the firmware accumulator. The shape
        is (number_of_results, NBINS, NCORR_PROD).

        A method for computing and storing visibility data for a small interferometer. 

        Keep in mind that the default UCAP mode is 0, meaning that bursts of ADC and FFT data have 2 frames per input channel.

        observe() is only used with the channelizers configured to capture real data from each ADC. The channelizer is configured
        automatically when this function is called.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data_path : (str) The path to the directory to which visibility data will be written. If it doesn't exist, a parent directory will be created according
        to data_path. Within this directory, another directory will be created according to the date and time of the acquisition. HDF5 files will be written within 
        this directory, beginning with 0.hdf5 and incrementing the number by 1 with each new file. In this manner, all data can be stored in a parent directory,
        with specific acquisitions identified by the date and time of the acquisiton.

        obs_tag : (str) Observation tag added to end of obs_string, which together correspond to the observation file name.

            For D3A, obs_tag = '_D3A_rfsoc' for backwards compatibility. 

        digital_gains_path : (str) The path to which digital gains will be stored, or the file from which digital gains will be called. If None, then observe()
        will compute the digital gains with self.compute_gains(), which will be stored in the directory f'{data_path}/digital_gains/{obs_string}_digitalgain' as
        the file 'gains.hdf5'. The obs_string corresponds to the date and time of the acquisition, as with the data itself.

        If digitial_gains_path is specified, observe() will search for a 'gains.hdf5' file within the specified directory. These gains will be opened and set 
        in the Scaler during the observation. 

        n_vis_per_file : (int) The number of visibilities to store per HDF5 file. Increasing this number will increase the size of each HDF5 file. Reducing this
        may be useful to collect more ADC and/or FFT snapshots during the observation, as the ADC and/or FFT snapshots are collected when a new HDF5 file is created. 

        n_software_frames : (int) The number of pre-integrated firmware frames to integrate in Python.
        Increasing this value increases the total integration time.

        autocorr_only : (int) Bit to choose between return all correlated products, or only autocorrelations.
        Default is to send all N(N-1)/2 correlated products.

            0: return all products
            1: return autocorrelations only

        no_accum : (int) Bit to choose between accumulating (i.e., summing) correalted SCALER frames, and not
        accumulating. Default is to accumulate.

            0: do accumulate
            1: do not accumulate

        n_firmware_frames : (int) Number of frames to accumulate in firmware. Take care not to set this too 
        low (see minimum), as this will increase the data rate, and could lead to overrun condition. Also take
        care not to set this too high (see maximum), as this may cause increased saturation. The firmware 
        accumulator can add numbers up to 18+18-bit values, at which point they saturate.

        Use the recommended value!

            16384 - 1: recommended
            32768 - 1: maximum

        gain_target : (float) The average magnitude of the 4+4-bit SCALER frames. If target is too low, quantization
        noise will begin to dominate over the signal. If target is too high, both the SCALER and the accumulator 
        of the correlator might saturate. The recommended value is borrowed from that used in the CHIME F-Engine,
        which was determined empirically by Prof. Juan Mena-Parra of UofT. 

        To check that you're meeting the target, run compute_gains(), and recover many (e.g., 100) Scaler frames, compute their magnitude, and take the
        mean across the frame ("time") axis. Compare the mean to the target; the mean magnitude should look like noise whose average value should
        approximately meet the target.

        n_fft_frames_for_gain_comp : (int) The number of FFT frames used to calculate the digital gains. It is recommended 
        to set this to approximately 1000 to reduce the noiise of the averaged magnitude of the FFT data.

        gain_type : (str) Specifies whether any post-processing is applied to the computed digital gains. The default is 'raw', meaning no additional processing
        is done after computing digital gains. See compute_gains() for further details --- note that 'raw' has performed the best out of the current algorithms.

        capture_adc_bursts : (bool) Specifies whether to capture ADC frames at the beginning of each HDF5 file. If True, capture ADC data. If False, don't capture
        ADC data.

        n_adc_frames_per_file : (int) The number of ADC frames to capture for each HDF5 file if capture_adc_bursts = True. Note that the data volume for a single capture is

            16384 samples per frames * 16 frames per capture * 16 bits per sample / 8 bits per byte / 1e6 B per MB = 0.524288 MB of data.

        capture_fft_bursts : (bool) Specifies whether to capture FFT frames at the beginning of each HDF5 file. If True, capture FFT data. If False, don't capture
        FFT data.

        n_fft_frames_per_file : (int) The number of FFT frames to capture for each HDF5 file if capture_fft_bursts = True. Note that the data volume for a single capture is

            16384 samples * 16 frames per capture * (32+32) bit per sample / 8 bits per byte / 1e6 B per MB = 2.097152 MB of data.
