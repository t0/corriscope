    The object offers `start` and `stop` methods to start and stop the receivers, a method to grab a
    snapshot of the current data, and a method to start a thred that continuously writes the data to
    disk if HDF5 format.

    This reciever uses Threads to implement concurrency, not Tornado.

    Packet buffer contract (aligned with :class:`~corriscope.common.udp_packet_receiver.UDPPacketReceiver`

    ``buf``, ``pkt_len``, ``n_packets``, ``n_stored``, ``max_packet_size``, and :meth:`flush`.

    Notes:
        The performance ofthis receiver is limited by Python. It is meant to be used mostly for debugging.

            name (str): Name of the receiver array, used for logging


            ports (list of dict): describe the ports to be created. The list is in the format::

                [ {'port': port_id, 'sources': list_of_sources}, ...]


                Where :

                    port_id: the ID of the port to be created.

                       If the ``port_id`` is a string ID, a port number will
                       be selected automatically and *all* sources with that
                       same `port_id` will be assigned to that port.

                       If ``port_id`` is a non-zero integer, it will be
                       interpreted as a port number and all sources will be
                       assigned to that port number.

                       port number.


                    list_of_sources:  (list of tuples): List of address:port
                        tuples [(addr, port)...] that describe the IceBoards
                        that will be sending data to this port. A TCP

                            1) confirm the presence of the source,

                            2) determine on which interface we should listen to,

                            3) and teach the switches routing table how to
                               route the UDP packets from the source to this
                               receiver (See Note below)


            stream_ids (list of int): List of STREAM iD that are expected to
                be received. This will be used to preallocate and classify the
                incoming data. Any packets with a STREAM ID that is not in
                this list will be rejected.


            jump_thresholds (list of int): Threshold values

            metrics_refresh_time (float): cadence in seconds at which metrics are updated

            adc_rms_refresh_count (float): number of frames to average for the rms cache

        Returns:
            A dict with the following keys:
                status:  Status of the receiver
                recv_addr: Receiver addresses to which each source should send its data. This is a dict in the format::

                        {(src_addr, src_port):(recv_addr, recv_port, recv_mac_addr),...}


        Notes:

            * Concerning item 3), the FPGAs will send UDP data to a specific
              MAC and IP address without possibly ever having received a
              directed packets from the server. This means that the switch
              might not know on which port to forward the packet towards the
              receiver, which will cause the switches to broadcast the data
              everywhere. If we **assume that the specified source addresses
              have interfaces on the same switch as the interface that sends
              the UDP packets***, establishing a bidirectional TCP connection
              to the source will tell all the switches between the source and
              the receiverhow to direct the data flow towards the server. This
              TCP connection needs to be redone periodically to prevent the
              cached entries in the switches MAC address tables from expiring.

            * In `ports`, ``port_id`` can appear in multiple entries; this is
              therefore why `ports` is not structured as a {port_id:sources}
              dict.


        Todo:
            - Might need to ping the source periodically as the switches may clear their routing
              tables periodically for stale entries.
            - Port numbers could in fact just be IDs or zero, and the server could assign its own port for each ID.
            - There is currently no way to assign port numbers to specific interfaces. The system
              will work only if 1) all the ports are in the same interface which connect to all
              FPGAs ping addresses), or 2) ports listen to all interfaces. Not clear if the later
              can be related to a performance issue. Unless all ports listen to all interfaces, each
              port shall be associated with a ping address to we know on which interface it should
              connect.
