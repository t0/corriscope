        .. centered:: **Hardware map creation parameters**

        Parameters:

            hwm (str, list or HardwareMap): Describes the hardware
                map, which lists the motherboards (CRS boards) and crates (CRS backplanes)
                that are present in the system and their relationship. The hardware
                map creation depending on the type of the `hwm` parameter.

                - *str* or *list of str* : A string or list of strings that describes the hardware to be
                  added to the hardware map in the format::

                      hwm := {board_descriptors | crate_descriptors} ...

                  where

                  ``board_descriptors := {CRS serial[:slot[:crate_number]] [serial[:slot[:crate_number]]] ... | hostname | ip_address}``

                  ``crate_descriptors := {CRC4 serial[:crate_number] [serial[:crate_number]] ...}``,

                  Autodiscovery is used as needed to complete the hardware map
                  (see notes below).

                - *list of dict*: list of dicts that describe the hardware map elements to create.

                - *HardwareMap*: Fully formed hardware map, provided directly as a
                  HardwareMap database object. If a fully-formed hardware map is
                  provided, it will additionally be vetted by removing the
                  Iceboards that fail the `ping` test and do not meet the
                  ``subarray`` criteria.


        .. centered:: **Hardware map filtering parameters**

        Parameters:


            subarrays (list): List of integers describing the subarrays to include in
                the default Motherboard set. If None, all
                Iceboards in the hardware map will be selected. Affects only the
                boards specified in the hardware map specified with the ``hwm`` parameter.

            ping (int): If ``ping=1``, The connection to Iceboards is checked
                by sending a dummy Tuber (http) request to their ARM processors. If a
                YAML-specified iceboards fails, it is simply removed from the
                ``hwm`` hardware map, but an exception is raised if a board listed
                explicitely fails. If ``ping`` is false, the presence of boards is not
                checked.

            platform_firmware_pathname (str): Optional path to platform ARM
                firmware used during network discovery. For CRS, ``None`` uses
                the default ``tcpipe_rtos.elf`` in the CRS ``arm_firmware`` folder.


        .. centered:: **Configuration & initialization parameters**

        Parameters:

            mode (str): Operational mode of required from the Motherboard
                array.

                The mode is used to select which FPGA firmware to load, unless
                overriden by the `bitfile` parameter .

                When `mode` is specified, the FPGA configuration (prog=2) and
                full initialization level (init=2) is implied, unless specifically
                modified by the prog and init commands.

                The following modes are supported (CRS platform):

                    - 'corr8': 8 inputs of one board fed to the on-FPGA correlator (pocket correlator).
                    - 'corr32': 4 boards on one backplane shuffled into a 32-input correlator.
                    - 'corr64': 8 boards on two backplanes (SFP cables between boards) into a 64-input correlator.
                    - 'shuffle8'/'chan8': channelize and stream out through UPACK/100GE (no correlator).

            bitfile (str): If `bitfile` points to a folder, use that folder to look for the default
                FPGA bitstream base don the platform/mode. If `bitfile` points to a file, use that
                file as a bitstream (but mode is still required to properly initialize the python
                object and firmware)

            prog (int): Overrides the FPGA configuration level. If `mode` is specified, `prog`
                defaults to `prog` =2 otherwise `prog` =0.

                - prog=0 or None: The FPGAs are not configured
                - prog=1: the FPGAs are configured only if they are not already configured with the same
                  firmware.
                - prog=2: The FPGAs are always configured, ensuring a clean-state start.

            init (int): Sets the array initialization level. Defaults to ``init=3`` if `mode` is specified, otherwise defaults to ``init=0``

                - init=0: Only creates the array and establish communication with the motherboards.
                - init=1: like init=0, but configure the FPGA using prog=2
                  unless explicitely specified, and creates the ``fpga`` object representing the loaded firmware. `mode` or `bitfile` must be specified so
                  the bitfile to be used can be found.
                - init=2: like init=1, but basic communication with the FPGAs
                  is established and the `fpga` object is populated with the
                  objects representing the firmware modules.
                - init=3: full initialization of the FPGA in the specified `mode` is performed

            if_ip (str): string corresponding to the IP address of adapter through
                which the connection to the FPGA will be established. If not
                specified, the system will assume that the FPGA is reached trough
                the same interface that reaches the platform on-board processor.


            udp_retries (int): Number of retries performed when UDP command
                packets sent to the FPGA do not receive a response. Applies
                only to platform that feature direct UDP communication with
                the FPGA.

            fpga_ip_addr_fn (str): For platforms featuring direct UDP
                connection with the FPGA, specifies how the FPGA IP address is
                determined. The valid modes are shown below, and should be
                types exactly without additional spaces. In those modes,
                ``a.b.c.d`` corresponds to the IP address of the IceBoard ARM
                processor.

                - '(a,b,3,d)': Uses the IP address of the ARM but replaces the third byte by ``3``
                - '(a,b,c+1,d)': Uses the IP address of the ARM but adds 1 to the third byte


            sync_method (str): Method used to synchronize (to sync) the data acquisition on an array of boards:

                - 'local': Syhchronize each board individually by software trigger. There is no synchronicity between boards.
                - 'irigb': uses the IRIG-B time signal to perform an array-wide synchronization. The source of the IRIG-B signal can be specified in `sync_source`.
                - Other modes are available

            sync_source (str): Source of the signal that is used to synchronize each board


            sync_master (Motherboard or str): Board used to generate the synchrization signal,

            sync_master_source (str): Source of the synchronization signal generated by the master board

            sync_master_output (int): User output on which the synchronization signal is routed on the master board

            max_sync_time_difference (int): Maximum time difference, in
                nanoseconds, between the time of frame 0 of each board in an
                array.

        .. centered:: **Corner-turn engine parameters**

        Parameters:

            frames_per_packet (int): Number of frames that are grouped in each
                packets at the output of the corner turn engine. Default is 2.
                Packets contents is ordered so that the data from both frames
                shows in a single block, followed by the scaler flages for
                both frames, etc. Is limited by the amount of buffering
                available in the FPGA's corner turn engine stages. Contiguous
                data blocks help the receiver node make more efficient memory
                transfers.

            tx_power (dict): Initial training and final TX power levels to be
                assigned to the data links used by the corner turn engine.
                These include the backplane PCB links between boards in a
                crate, backplane QSFP links between crates, or iceboard QSFP
                links that offload  the output of the corner turn engine.


            corner_turn_bad_links (list of tuples): List of corner turn engine
                outputs links [(crate, slot, links), ...] that should
                preferably NOT be assigned any frequency bins if possible.

            corner_turn_bin_priority (list of int): List of frequency bins
                that are to be assigned to the corner turn output, in order of
                priority (most desirable frequency first). The lowest priority
                bins will be assigned to the bad links as much as possible,
                depending on the constraints of the corner turn engine
                flexibility.

            corner_turn_remap_level (int): Sets the aggressivness of the remapping by
                selecting how many crossbar levels are involved. 0:no
                remapping, 1: 3rd crossbar only, 2: crossbars 2 and 3, 3: all
                crossbars.

        .. centered:: **Firmware correlator parameters**

        Parameters:

            integration_period (int): =None,


        .. centered:: **Logging parameters**

        Parameters:

            stderr_log_level (str): sets up a handler that prints logs of specified log level on stderr.

            syslog_log_level (str): sets up a SYSLOG handler


        Logging
        -------

        You can optionally specify log level arguments to create syslog and stderr handlers to help interactive operations. If a
        handler already exists, its log level is simply updated to prevent duplication of
        handlers. Log levels can be strings or numerical log levels.



        Example:

            **Hardware map specifications**

            ``hwm="crc4 1"`` selects all CRS boards on backplane (crate) SN001.

            ``hwm="crs 0037 0039"``, ``hwm="crs 37:1 39:2"`` (serial:slot) or
            ``hwm="crs 192.168.88.29"`` select the CRS boards specified by
            serial (with optional slot and crate number), hostname or IP address.

            Note:

                If a Motherboard is specified by IP address (e.g. '10.10.10.7'),
                then the board can be added directly in the hardware map. This
                does *not* rely on the system mDNS client or the Python
                ``pybonjour`` package.

                If an Motherboard is specified by its mDNS hostname (e.g.
                'iceboard0007.local'), the operating system will automatically
                resolve the IP address using mDNS, assuming that a mDNS client
                (Bonjour on Windows or Mac, avahi on Linux) is running on this
                computer. The ``pybonjour`` Python package is *not* needed.

                In both cases, the crate, slot and serial number information will
                be automatically obtained directly through the Motherboard's
                processor if that information not already present in the hardware
                map.

                If an Motherboard is specified by its serial number (e.g. '0007', or
                just a numeric 7 as a convenient shortcut), the board will use its
                platform-specific network discovery method to actively find boards
                that match the serial number.


            Note:

                Selecting boards by Crate serial number uses the platform-specific
                network discovery method for that crate type.

    Creates FPGAArray object interactively from the command line and/or a YAML
    configuration file, mainly for debugging and testing. All command-line
    options can also be specified directly in the YAML file.

    The function can also create simple GPU nodes and power supply objects to
    assist testing of the FPGA array.

    The hardware map describing all the components of the FPGA array
    (motherboards, backplanes, mezzanines) can be specified by explicitrly
    instantiating the corresponding objects in the YAML file (e.g.
    IceBoardPlus!{...}).

    Alternatively, the hardware can  be specified  using the command line
    arguments or their equivalent entries in the configuration file, which
    allow those objects to be created from the motherboard IP address,
    hostname or serial number, or just the crate serial number. When serial
    numbers are specified, boards and crates and are looked up on the locan
    network using mDNS.

    Examples:

    - create_fpga_array crs 192.168.88.29 192.168.88.30   # two CRS boards at explicit IP addresses
    - create_fpga_array crs 0005 0006   # two CRS boards by serial number (resolved with CRS network beacons)
    - create_fpga_array crs 5:1 6:2   # same, with explicit slot numbers
    - create_fpga_array crc4 1   # all boards on CRS backplane (crate) serial 1

    In the configuration file, some parameters are grouped in the following sub-dictionaries:

    root object::

        logging:     # Contains all the parameters related to logging
        fpga_array:  # Contains all the parameters related to the creation and
                     # initialization of the FPGA motherboards, crates and mezzanines
        gpu_array:   # Contains all the parameters related to the creation and
                     # initialization of the GPU nodes

    Example::

        my_config:
            fpga_array:
                hwm: "crs 0005 0006"  # or any other syntax accepted by the command line
                ...
            logging:
                log_target: "syslog"
            ...

    Generic parameters (root dict)
    ------------------------------

    yaml: Name of a YAML configuration file to load. One or more root object
       can be specified, in which case the filename and the list of root
       objects must be separated by a single ':'. If multiple root objects are
       specified, they are all combined and lists or dictionaries with similar
       names are all combined.

       Objects can be specified hierarchically using the '.' hierarchy
       separator. An object starting with '.' starts at the same node level as
       the previous object.

    Example::

        --yaml file1.yaml # Load config from the top node of the file
        --yaml file1.yaml:site1 # Load  config from the site1 element
        --yaml file1.yaml:site1 site2# Load config by combining the elements of site1 and site2 objects
        --yaml file1.yaml:site1.boards .gpus .ps  # combine site1.boards, site1.gpus and site1.ps


    FPGA array parameters (``fpga_array`` sub-dict)
    -----------------------------------------------

    Here is a summary of the FPGA array creation parameters. Detailed
    description of each parameter is profided in the ``FPGAArray`` object.

    - hwm: Contains a hardware map object (config file only, created with HardwareMap! object)

    - mdns_timeout: Time to wait for motherboards to responds to mDNS queries

    - arm_firmware_pathname: Path to platform ARM firmware used by
        network discovery. For CRS, None uses the default tcpipe_rtos_rtos.elf in the
        CRS arm_firmware folder.

    - subarrays: Keep only iceboards that are in the specified subarrays
        (applicable only to objects created explicitely in the
        configuration file)

    - ping: Keep only boards that respond to requests

    - bitfile: path of the folder in which to search for default FPGA
        bitstream files (based on the platform and mode), or full pathname
        to a FPGA bitstream to use (mode must still be specified to allow
        proper initialization)


    - prog: Overrides the default FPGA bitstream configuration level. 0=Do not program, 1=program if needed, 2=always program.

    - init: Overrides the array initialization level. 0=just connect to platform, 1= program FPGA, 2= connect to firmware and configure firmware object, 3=initialize firmware indesired mode.

    - if_ip: address of the interface used to communicate with the FPGA. If
        not specified, the same interface as the one used for communicate
        with the ARM processor is used.

    - sampling_frequency: Specifies the ADC sampling frequency in Hz (3200 MHz on CRS). If `None`, the platform/firmware mode default is used.

    - reference_frequency: Specifies the frequency of the system's reference clock in Hz (typically 10 MHz). If `None`, the platform/firmware mode default is used.

    - data_width: Bit width used after the channelizer's scaler (4 or 8)

    - sync_method: string describing the method used to synchronize all the boards in the array

    - sync_source: string describing the source of the synchronization signal.


    Logging parameters: (``logging`` sub-dict)
    ------------------------------------------

    - log_target : String indicating the logging target (default = 'syslog'). May be

        - 'stream' : logs on stdout (not recommended in interactive sessions)
        - 'syslog': logs on Syslog on localhost
        - any other string: logs to a file specified by the string

    - log_level : String indicating the logging level. May be 'info',
        'error', 'warning' , 'debug'. default is 'debug'.

    - sql_log_level : String indicating SQLAlchemy logging level. Same
        values as ``log_level``. Defaults to 'warning'.

    - stderr_log_level : String indicating what messages to log on stderr
       (usually the console) in addition to the main log target. Is usually
       used to make sure that important messages (warnings and errors) are
       seen immediately by the interactive operator. Values are the same as
       ``log_level``. Defaults to 'warning'.
