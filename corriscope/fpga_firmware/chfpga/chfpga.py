                generates the FPGA address (A,B,C,D) based on the ARM IP address
                (a,b,c,d).

            fpga_control_port_number (int): FPGA's listening port number for commands. Defaults to 41000. If None,
                the local port number is used.

            local_control_port_number (int): UDP port number to use to receive command
                replies. If 0, the number is allocated randomly by the OS. If
                None, a fixed number based on the crate_number and a slot number
                will be used if available.

            interface_ip_addr (str): IP address of the interface to be used to
                communicate with both the ARM and FPGA. If `None`, the interface
                will be detected automatically by establishing a connection with
                the ARM.

            irigb_source (str): IRIG-B source name to select after MMI is up.
                If ``None``, the decoder source is left unchanged. Specifying this parameter 
                allows the IRIG-B decoder to be setup as soon as possible during the init sequence 
                so it can decode its first valid second as soon as possible.

                 `None`, in which case the value is taken from firmware parameter table.

             processing_frequency (float): Frequency of the internally generated channelizer signal
                 processing clock in Hz. Is compared with sampling_frequency/4 to determine if we
                 can use the internal clock instead of the ADC clock to avoid causing large current
                 spikes when we start and stop the ADCs. Is notmally `None`, in which case the
                 platform/mode defaut is used.

             reference_frequency (float): Frequency in Hz of the Iceboard's reference clock (default
                 is 10 MHz). Normally `None`, in which case the value is taken from firmware parameter table.

                 A default delay table is used if none is provided.

             adc_clock_divider (float): ratio between the ADC sampling frequency and the measured
                 ADC clock speed. Is normally `None` to use the platform/mode default.

             data_width (int): 4 or 8. Indicate of the channelizer output is in (4+4)bit or (8+8
                 bit) mode

             enable_gpu_link (bool): 1

        Parameters:

            trig (bool): if trig=True, a trigger is generated to capture the

                or automatically (by a SYNC event, for example)

            noerror (bool): Suppress the raising of error in the case the
                IRIG-B time is not valid (i.e not updated or has invalid
                values)

            wait (bool): If True (default) and ``trig`` is True, retry for up
                to 2.5 s until ``recent`` and the HMS/day fields are valid.
                If False, make a single capture. Async callers should pass
                False and sleep on the event loop between attempts.


        Returns:

            an _IrigTimestamp object which contains the captured.


        Notes:

            The retuned time is advanced by one second to account for the fact
            that the IRIG-B time decode by the IRIG-B FPGA logic is latched on the
            beginning of the following second. However, the pipelining delay

                `None`, the current FPGA IRIG time is used.

            delay (float): is a time offset in seconds that is added to `datetime_` to set the
                target time. This delay can be specified with an accuracy of up to 10 ns (lower digits are
                ignored and assumed to be zero). If `datetime` is specified, it defaults to zero
                (i.e the specified `datetime` is the target time, so it is assumed to be in the
                future). If `datetime` is not specified, (i.e. it will be the currnt FPGA time),
                `delay` defaults to 3 seconds. The FPGA comparator is programmed one second
                earlier than this sum so it matches the decoder fields.


        Be aware of the limited resolution of floating points. With a float in python (a double), it is not possible to
        represent a delay of more than about 1E6 seconds (11 days) without losing the 10 nanosecond
        resolution. Hence the use of a low accuracy reference time and a high accuracy delay relative to that time.


        Returns:

            _IrigTimestamp object: contains the programmed trigger time expressed as a
                `datetime` object (.datetime) and in nanoseconds since epoch (.nano).

        If the trigger is used for synchronizing boards, the delay should be a
        multiple of 100 ns in order to ensure alignment with the 10 MHz
        reference clock and ensure deterministic start of the syncronization
        state machine.

        If `datetime_` and 'delay' are None, the trigger time is set 3 seconds
        after the current time (as returned by the board).

        The CRS uses the UCAP capture engine; parameters marked "PROBER only" are kept for API
        compatibility with the IceBoard PROBER engine and are ignored here.

        Parameters:

            period (float): Time (in seconds) between captured bursts

            burst_period_in_seconds (float): Same as `period` or as a number of frames

            burst_period_in_frames (int): Number of frames between captured bursts - 1 second corresponds to approximately 39 000 frames.

            burst_period_frame_rounding (int): rounds burst period to an integer multiple of `burst_period_frame_rounding`.

            frames_per_burst (int): (PROBER only) Number of frames to send in a single burst. Default is 1.
                Limited by buffer space in the FPGA. This field is ignored if the UCAP capture
                engine is used by the platform (see ``mode`` parameter).

            source (str or int): Capture source name or logical index.

                - ``'funcgen'`` / ``0``: data after the function generator (ADC or waveform).
                - ``'scaler'`` / ``1``: data on the scaler capture port.

            data_type (str or int): If the data is from the scaler, indicates what type of data is to be captured.
                For scaler capture modes 4/5 (multi-packet logical decode), one host logical frame is reconstructed
                from packets produced by consecutive physical frames; it is not replayed from a single buffered frame.

            channels (list): list of channels for which the data capture will be enabled (UCAP):
                Only specified channels will be captured. The number of allowed channels differs depending
                on `mode`:

                  - mode 0: All 8 channels are sent, and `channels` must be exactly [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. This is the default when None.
                  - mode 1: Any 4 channels are sent. `channels` must be a list of exactly 4 channel numbers. Default when None is [0,1,2,3].
                  - mode 2: Any 2 channels are sent. `channels` must be a list of exactly 2 channel numbers. Default when None is [0,1].
                  - mode 3: A single `channel` is sent. Default when None is [0].

            sync (bool): When True, a local sync is performed.

            verbose (int): A non-zero value increases the amount of information that is printed or logged.

            offset (int): (PROBER only) Number that translates to how many frames are skipped before the capture
                counters starts after a sync(). This is used to stagger capture frame transmission
                between boards in a crate to prevent UDP packets from being dropped by a switch.

            send_delay (int): (PROBER) Time delay in PROBER ``SEND_DELAY`` units. (UCAP)
                ``READOUT_DELAY`` in ADC input frames (0–65535). Per-board staggering is applied by
                :meth:`~corriscope.fpga_firmware.chfpga.chfpga_array_methods.start_data_capture_async`.

            mode (int): (UCAP only). Sets the UCAP cature mode:

                - 0: captures 2 contiguous frames from all 8 channels (``channels`` has no effect)
                - 1: captures 4 contiguous frames from the first 4 channels listed in ``channels``.
                - 2: captures 8 contiguous frames from the first 2 channels listed in ``channels``.
                - 3: captures 16 contiguous frames from the first channel listed in ``channels``.

        Data is sent as periodic bursts of M frames (`frames_per_burst`) and continues

            bypass_data_type: Sets the mode of the science output. These are:
                - 0: The input FFT data is forwarded directly to the output.
                - 1: If an overflow occurs in either the real or imaginary component of the bin, 1+0j is output for that bin. Otherwise, 0+0j is output.
                - 2: If a positive overflow occurs in the real component of the bin, 1+0j is output for that bin. If a negative overflow occurs in that component, 0+1j is output. Otherwise, 0+0j is output.
                - 3: If a positive overflow occurs in the imaginary component of the bin, 1+0j is output for that bin. If a negative overflow occurs in that component, 0+1j is output. Otherwise, 0+0j is output.
            Note that setting bypass_data_type also automatically sets the bypass register to True (otherwise the science output will continue outputting normal)

            cap_data_type: Sets the mode of the capture output. These are:
                - 0: Forward science output directly to capture output.
                - 1: Output the input FFT data.
                - 2: Output raw scaled FFT data, before rounding is applied. The data is saturated, but disregarding symmetric saturation.
                - 3: Output 4+4 bit scaled FFT data (e.g. normal scaler output, even if the science output is set to another mode)
                - 4: Output the input FFT data of the even bins and then the odd bins in an alternating fashion, at double the bitwidth.
                - 5: Output the input FFT data of each Re and Im component one at a time, at the full bitwidth.
                - 6: Output post-gain saturation flags per bin (Re/Im as 0, +1, or -1 in each capture field).
            For modes 4 and 5, one host logical frame is reconstructed from packets produced by consecutive
            physical frames (not from a single fully buffered physical frame).

        Sets the digital gain used by the SCALER module to scale the (18+18)
        bits output of the FFT to the (4+4) final channelizer output format.

        The gain can be set individually for every frequency bins and every
        ADC channel.

        Parameters:

            gain (scalar, tuple, list or dict): Linear gain and optional postscaler gain to apply to the
                specified channels. Gain elements can be defined as:

                - G = Glin_scalar: Single gain for all bins, default postscaler is used
                - G = (Glin_scalar, None): same as above
                - G = (Glin_scalar, Glog): Single gain for all bins with specified postscaler
                - G = Glin_vector: Gain value for each bin, using the default post-scaler value
                - G = (Glin_vector, None): same as above
                - G = (Glin_vector, Glog): Gain value for each bin with specified post-scaler value

                where:

                - ``Glin_scalar`` is a real or complex number. The real and imaginary part of the
                  linear gain are integer values ranging from -32768 to 32767.

                - ``Glog`` is the postscaler factor. This is a binary scaling factor, which is an
                  integer between 0 and 31 representing a power of two that multiplies the linear
                  gain. It is common to every bin.

                - ``Glin_vector`` is a 1024-element vector of ``Glin_scalar``, where each element is
                  the individual gain of every bin.

                `gain` can take the following form:

                - `gain` = G. If `gain` is a scalar or tuple, the specified gains are applied to all
                  channels specified in `channels`.

                - `gain` = {ch_number1: G1, ch_number2: G2 ...}: If `gain` is  a dict, the gain is
                  applied to specified channel numbers, but only if they are included in `channels`

                - `gain` = [ (ch_number1, G1),  (ch_number2, G2), ...] or `gain` = [ (ch_list1 ,
                  G1), (ch_list2, G2), ...]: If `gain` is a list of tuples, a specified gain ``G``
                  profile is applied to unique channels number or to all channels in a of a list of
                  channel numbers. Channels not specified in `channels` are not set.

            postscaler (int): Postscaler factor to apply if ``Glog`` is not specified (Glog=None) in
                ``gain``.

            channels (list of int): channels to which the gain is applied. If 'channels' is None, it
                is applied to the default (active) channels (see set_default_channels()).

            bank (int): The memory bank to which the gains should be applied (0 or 1) Once written,
                the bank is made active. If ``bank`` is None, the currently inactive bank is used.

            when (int): Specifies when the specified gains shall become active. If `when` is 'now', the
                gains are written immediately on the target bank and the bank is made active on the
                next frame. If `when` is an  *int*, the gains are written immediately to the bank  bank,
                but than bank will become active only on frame number (timestamp) specified by when.

            gain_timestamp: Unix timestamp when the gains were calculated.  If not provided,
                defaults to current time.

            use_fixed_gain (bool): (deprecated) if True, enables the use of fixed gain mode of the scaler module. In this
                case, 'gain' can only be a scalar. Is False by default.



        The actual gain between the scaler input and output for bin 'b' is:

           - 4-bit mode: out/in = :math:`Glin(b) * 2**(Glog-31)`

           - 8-bit output: out/in = :math:`Glin(b) * 2**(Glog-27)`


        Notes:
            #) The PFB/FFT has an intrinsic gain of 512 (a constant FFT input of '1' will yield the value 512 in bin 0 at the input of the scaler.
            #) If the FFT is bypassed, the 8-bit values from the ADC or the function generator are applied directly to the scaler input.
            #) In 4-bit mode, the output value is taken from bits 31 to 34 of the postscaled-value. In 8-bit mode, bits 27 to 31 are used.
            #) A smaller postscaler value allows a larger gain to be used to achieve the same overall gain while providing more gain resolution.
            #) A gain of (1, 31) allows the function generator values to appear on the scaler output with an overall gain of 1 in 4-bit mode. This is equivalent to (2, 30), (4,29) ... (16384, 8), except that the latter offers more gain resolution.
            #) A gain of (1, 27) dies the same in 8-bit mode.
            #) (16384, 8), except that the latter offers more gain resolution.

        Examples:
            set_gain(1) # Sets all gains to 1, leaves the poscslaler unchanged for all channelizers.
            set_gain((1, None)) # Same thing
            set_gain(postscaler = 26) # Sets postscaler on all channelizers
            set_gain((1,31)) # For all channelizers, sets all gains to 1 and postscaler to 31
            set_gain(16384,8) # In 4-bit, FFT enabled mode, outputs a value of '1' on bin 0 when the input of the FFT is a constant '1'.
