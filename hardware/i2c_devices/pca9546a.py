class pca9546a(object):

    Implements the interface to the PCA9546A 4-port I2C switch.

    Parameters:

        i2c_interface (I2CInterface object): object providing the write command to the I2C bus on which the device is connected.

        address (int): 7-bit I2C address of this device

        port (int or dict): integer specyfing which I2C port to use, or dict describing the I2C switch and switch parameters to use.

        verbose (int): sets the amount of messages printed

    The switch has a single register: the control register, whose 4 lsb bits
    enables the connection of each input bus to the output bus.

        Parameters:

            ports (int or list of int): port number(s) to activate. Cannot be used with `bitmask`

            bitmask (int): 4-bit value indicating the state of each bus.
