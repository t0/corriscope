            addr (int): Address from which to read within the BSB address
                space. The control/status/RAM pages are determined from the high
                bits of the address.

            type (``int``, str or dtype): Selects the type of returned object

                - ``int`` object: a single integer of `length` bytes is read as a **big endian** and is returned.
                - ``bytes`` or ``bytearray`` object: A ``bytearray`` is returned.
                - dtype or string representing a dtype: Returns a numpy array of `length` numpy objects of dtype `type`.


            length (int): Indicates the number of bytes (if type==int) or the number of numpy elements of dtype==type to read.
                Multiple transactions will be performed if the requested number of bytes cannot be obtained in a single one.

            timeout (float): If not None, sets the timeout period for the read transaction.

            retry (int): Number times the read is retried. If None, the default is used.

            resync (bool): If True, the receiver will ignore command sequence number
                mismatches and will resynchronize the local counter with the value
                that was received. This is normally done only once when the system is
